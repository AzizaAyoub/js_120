/*
Global Object:

What is the global object? 

Global object is an object that javascript creats when the code is running. We call it global objec in node.js and window in browsers 

What does global object contain? 

The global object has some properties like NaN, Infinity, and methods like isNaN, parseInt. 

What will happen if we  variables without using any keyword? 

It will create this as a property in the global object instead of decalaring this as a varaible. 

And we can access these properties by using the global object as a caller.
