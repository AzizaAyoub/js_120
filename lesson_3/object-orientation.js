/*
Object-Orientation :


Object-Oriented programming is a pattern that uses objects as the basic building blocks of a program instead of using local variables and functions. Like : 

*/

let obje = {
  name: 'Aziza', 
  age: 21,
}

// we can accomplish the same thing with variables :

let name = 'Aziza';
let age = 21;

/*
This code works correct but when we need hundreds or thousands of names and age variables we can't keep track of this simply. But the object-Oriented approach is even better it can hundle hundreds or thousands related data together. 


The benfites of object-Oriented programming :

  - It's easier to understand
  - The relationship between it and the data readly evident


 Objects:

  - organize related data and code together.
  - are useful when a program needs more than one instance of something.
  - become more useful as the codebase size increases.
